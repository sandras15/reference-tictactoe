###Employment history:
I am currently working at Hilton Reykjavík Nordica and at the consert hall Harpa in Reykjavik. At both places I am working as a Bartender and Waitress.

##What kind of software person are you? <br />
I am an apple fan to the deepest bone on my body. Everything I own that is possible to own from Apple inc, I have already. I am currently working on a new Macbook Pro for this project.

                           cpu = 2.9 GHz Core i5 (I5-5287U)
                        Memory = 16 GB 1867 MHz DDR3

##What do you expect to get out of this course? <br />
I expect to get a deeper and further understanding in software development. I want to be able to know that my work is perfect and not just assume. Companys now a a days are in need of better quality control so hopefully when I am done with this class I am able to bring that with me.
