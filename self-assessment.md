## Testing & logic

Outline what tests you created.

- Implemented UnitTests are the following:
	1. _should emit game created event_
	2. _should emit game joined event_
	3. _should emit FullGameJoinAttempted event when game full_
	4. _should emit MovePlaced on first game move_
	5. _should emit IllegalMove when square is already occupied_
	6. _should emit NotYourMove if attempting to make move out of turn_
	7. _should emit game won horizontally_
	8. _should emit game won vertically_
	9. _should emit game won sideways "\"_
	10. _should emit game won sideways "/"_
	11. _should not emit game draw if won on last move_
	12. _should emit game draw when neither wins_
	13. _should emit IllegalMove when square is already occupied_

- Unfortunatly the game is not playable :pensive:.

	- __URL:__ http://82.221.49.109:8080/job/TicTacToe_CommitStage/ 
	- The following job pulls any changes made to GitHub repository. Then it runs the "Docker Build" script and runs the UnitTests.
	- Code in configuration: <br />
		./buildDocker.sh

- __Deploy Stage:__ Yes :smiley:!
	- __URL:__ http://82.221.49.109:8080/job/TicTacToe_Deploy/ 
	- The following job deploys the image created in the Commit Stage over to the amazon server(AWS) and makes a secure copy of neccasary files over to AWS server also.
	- Code in configuration: <br />
		scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i "../sandras15-ec2-key-pair-oregon.pem" ./docker-compose.yaml ec2-user@35.165.28.215:~/docker-compose.yaml <br />
		scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i "../sandras15-ec2-key-pair-oregon.pem" ./.env ec2-user@35.165.28.215:~/.env <br />
		ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i "../sandras15-ec2-key-pair-oregon.pem" ec2-user@35.165.28.215 ./docker-compose-and-run.sh <br />




__I used the following features in Jenkins:__
- Pipeline :smiley:!
	- __URL:__ http://82.221.49.109:8080/view/TicTacToe_Pipeline/

- Test reports :smiley:!
